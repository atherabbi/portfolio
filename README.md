This repository contains my personal portfolio website, which I use to showcase my skills and experience to potential employers and clients. The website includes information about my education, work experience, and projects that I have worked on. 

I am always looking for new ways to improve my portfolio, so please feel free to leave feedback or suggestions in the issues section of this repository.
